# Rules and Regulations
## Competition format
The competition is divided into two sections (`People’s choice` and `Judges’ choice`) and all the participants will be automatically eligible for both of these. The theme for each month’s competition will be notified over email. The participants can submit a maximum of 3 photos to the ongoing theme.
### People’s choice
All the photos will be up for voting by the campus community. At the end of the competition, the two (or more, see below) most voted images will be declared as winner and runner-up. In case of a tie, the entries with the highest number of votes, will be considered as winners. 
### Judges’ choice
At the end of each round (theme) of the competition, our judges will assign points to each of the entries, and the one(s) with the most number of points will be declared as winners. 

*Winning entries will be projected on the electronic display boards across campus. If we get further support from NCBS, we will frame winning entries and display them in some common area inside campus. We might also upload winning entries to official social media channels like Facebook and Twitter (along with proper credits). However, such consent will be taken from the photographer before we upload them to social media.*

Competition will be carried out in following three phases
* `Submission phase` Participants can upload their photos for ongoing theme which will be eligible for both the categories (People’s choice as well as Judges’ choice)
* `Voting phase` Anyone with valid NCBS/InStem/CCAMP email ID can vote for People’s choice category.
* `Judging phase` Verification of photos for both categories and judging of photos for Judge’s choice category.

## Judges

The panel of judges will comprise of experts (if available), as well as the winners from the previous month. Hence, the latter will be unable to participate in the ongoing competition, but will be able to rejoin from the following month. This is in all fairness to boost the confidence of new photographers. 

## Eligibility
Anyone with a valid NCBS/InStem/CCAMP email account can participate in the competition. (See below note about guests and special uploads)

 ## Rules for photo submission
 
  * The participant should be the sole owner of the uploaded photo. The NCBS Honour Code is applicable here.
  * One can upload a photo taken from mobile cameras, point and shoot, DSLRs, microscopes etc.
  * Please note that one cannot delete an already uploaded photo, even if you are the owner of the same. However, one can edit the photo, its caption and/or description, at any time. See ‘Terms and Conditions’ section for further details.
  * If a photo is selected for by the people or the judges, the participant should be able to send a high resolution unedited image of the same. Original image SHOULD include all the metadata. Images without any metadata will not be accepted for the competition.
  * General photo editing like contrast, brightness, temperature, saturation etc., as well as cropping, HDR and stitched panorama is allowed. One can also use photo filters if needed for the theme or to convey a message, however it is advised not to use them excessively.
  * Use of watermark is acceptable, but discouraged. If you insist on using one, please use it non-destructively and subtly. Proper image credits will be given when your photo is printed and framed.
  * NAME, OR ANY ALPHA-NUMERALS OR SYMBOLS THAT REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF THE PARTICIPANT SHOULD NOT BE KEPT ON THE PHOTOGRAPH, OR AS THE FILE NAME.  
  * Do not use portraits without permission of the subject and/or model. Do not use any copyrighted or inappropriate material.

## Terms and conditions

 * Due to policies of the NCBS IT section, a participant cannot delete any photo that is already uploaded. However, they can edit or change it. If you want to delete a photo, please email the IT section (ithelp@ncbs.res.in) regarding the same.
 * Keep a copy of the original photo with you. Organisers are not responsible for any loss of photos due to any technical reason.
 * Organisers will not take the responsibility for any delay or suspension of the photo competition. We will try our best to run this competition smoothly.
 * Uploaded photo can be used to publicize photography competition or photography club ‘within campus’. If photographer do not want to use his/her photo for such purpose, please email us (photography@ncbs.res.in) and we will remove photo from such listings.

 * Organisers are not responsible for the quality of photo printed or any related delay.
 * We take great care of keeping photographer’s copyright intact. However, organisers are not responsible for any unauthorized use of photo. Competition is accessible to all NCBS/InStem/CCAMP users and there is no way to restrict download/screenshot of competition photos.

## Special cases and related policies 
### Cancellation of competition
Organisers might cancel ongoing competition if there are less than 10 entries in the competition. In such cases organisers will declare cancelation of current competition and will start new theme. Organisers might also cancel on going competition without any notice if there is any technical or administrative problem.  
### Number of winners
Total number of winners will be decided based on number of entries in the contest. There will be 1 winner per 15 entries or 2 (whichever is maximum). However, if there is a tie amongst the winners, number of winners might increase/decrease accordingly.
### Guest uploads 
We constantly get requests regarding participation in contest by the users who do not have valid institute email address. Currently entire competition is linked to intranet and all uploads, votes are linked to specific email account. Hence (for now) it is not possible to incorporate guest uploads. We will update our rules and regulations once we have some mechanism in place to tackle this problem. We cannot allow upload through friend/colleagues account because it will create some unnecessary loop holes into photo uploading policies. Also, it will be logistically difficult to organize. 
### Number of judges
We try our best to get expert judges and encourage previous competition winners to judge contest photos. However, that is subject to availability of judges. Sometimes we may not get enough judges to have Judges’ choice section. In such cases, organisers may try to contact other experts or experienced photographers to judge. At the end, if we have less than 2 judges, we might have to cancel the ‘Judges’ choice’ section of the competition. Organisers will take final decision regarding this. 
### Multiple photo uploads
As per our rules and regulations, maximum of 3 photos are allowed per theme. It is participant’s responsibility to check how much photos they are uploading. As photographers’ names are hidden in voting and uploading phase, it is not possible for organisers to detect and notify users who have uploaded more than 3 photos. If any photographer has uploaded more than 3 photos to current competition, only first 3 photos (based on uploading timestamps) will be considered for the competition. Rest of the photos may be removed from the website. 
### Judges’ scores
Judges’ score which have received after provided deadline will not be considered for the final calculation of ‘Judges’ choice’ score. Judges can contact organisers if they are unable to send scores before deadline. Organisers will always send one reminder before the deadline.  
### Runner up photos
To promote more photographers, we have started displaying runner up photos on the electronic display across campus. Number of runner up photos selected to display on the electronic display will be decided by the organisers. We will generally show 6 photos per sections. However, if there are multiple photos with same score, we might adjust this number. 
### Access to competition photographs
Sometimes we get request for accessing specific photographs for numerous reasons (like to use on personal website, use to create flyer etc.) We do NOT own copyright of any of the photo uploaded for the photography competition. Photographer will be sole copyright owner. Only thing we can provide is photographer’s email and name. You should contact him/her on your own regarding access to his/her photo. Organizing team will not be responsible for any such communication between photographers and others.
