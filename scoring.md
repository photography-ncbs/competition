# People's choice
Scoring process for people’s choice is very straight forward. During voting phase, each competition entry is open for anyone to vote on the scale of 0 to 5. All votes greater than 0 will be counted for final scoring. At the end of voting phase, total points will be calculated as follows,

    Total points = (Average Score) x (Number of non-zero votes)

Top two (or more in case of tie) entries will be selected for further processing. 
If any of the participant failed to comply with our [rules and regulation](Rules.md) guidelines, next highest score entry will be selected. 

# Judges' choice
All judges will be asked to score entries on the scale of 1 to 5. 
Judges should submit score for at least 8 entries (*This number might change depending on number of entries for specific competition. 
Judges will be informed accordingly*). 

Score from each judge will be normalize according to following formula,

    Normalized Score Percentage = (R – L)*100/ (H – L)

`Lowest score` (L): lowest score given by single judge to any entry, 
`Highest score` (H): highest score given by single judge to any entry,
`Raw Score` (R): Raw score of entry given by single judge 

Finally normalize score will be calculated according to following table

| Normalized Score Percentage | Final Normalized score |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 20 | 1 |
| 20 to 40 | 2 |
| 40 to 60 | 3 |
| 60 to 80 | 4 |
| 80 to 100 | 5 |

In case of boundary percentage, highest slab will be considered. For example, if Normalize Score Percentage is 40 then final score will be given as 3. 

Final score will be summation of such normalized scores from each judge. In case of expert or outsider judge, double weightage will be given. 
If any judge submits same score for all of his/her selected entries, each entry will be assign normalized score of 5 from that judge.

Top two (or more in case of tie) entries will be selected for further processing. 
If any of the participant failed to comply with our [rules and regulation](Rules.md) guidelines, next highest score entry will be selected.
